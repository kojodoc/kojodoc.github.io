## Project - Hunted 2, further gameplay improvement using AI.

In this activity, the core idea is to further improve the game mechanics for the Hunted game using AI.

**Project Tasks:**
* Become familiar with [Netlib](https://github.com/litan/ai_fundamentals/tree/main/netlib), the simple to use Neural Network library that is built on top of [Kojo-AI](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-3).
* Isolate the game mechanics improvements that you did in the previous chapter into a nice/clean function. This function should be implemented using rules/heuristics that you come up with.
* Now train a neural network to implement the above function. For this, you will need to generate training data for the kind of game response that you want, and then you can train a relatively simple regression network to learn the desired function.

A detailed example of how this can be done will be available soon.
