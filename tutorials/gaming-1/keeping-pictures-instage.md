## Keeping Pictures within the stage area

This activity has the following desired goals:
* Students will know how to draw the stage (**A**).
* Students will know how to use Vectors (**A, M**).
* Students will know how to check for collisions with the stage border (**A, M**).
* Students will know how to bounce pictures off the stage border (**A, M**).
* Students will understand the idea of collision detection and response (**M**).
* Students will be able to use the above ideas to animate multiple objects and keep them within the stage area (**M, T**).

### Step 1

Type in the following code and run it:

```scala
cleari()
drawStage(black)
```

Then zoom out the canvas a little.

**Q1a.** Do you see the stage area?

**Q1b.** What do you think is the use of the stage area?

---

### Explanation

The stage provides a backdrop on which you can have characters in an animation or game. The stage also enables collision detection and bouncing off its borders, thus making it easy to keep these characters within a confined area.

---

### Step 2

Type in the following code and run it:

```scala
// #exec template /picgaming

cleari()
drawStage(black)

val pic = Picture.rectangle(50, 50)
draw(pic)

var vel = Vector2D(50, 100)
animate {
    val dt = frameDeltaTime
    pic.translate(vel * dt)
    if (pic.collidesWith(stageBorder)) {
        vel = bouncePicOffStage(pic, vel)
    }
}
```

**Q2a.** What do you think is a `Vector2D`? How is it used in the code above?

**Q2b.** What do you think the `collidesWith` function does? What inputs does it take? What value does it return?

**Q2c.** What do you think the `bouncePicOffStage` function does? What inputs does it take? What value does it return?

**Q2d.** Can you explain the above code?

### Explanation

A vector can be defined in the following ways:
* As a quantity with a magnitude and a direction.
* As a multi-dimensional quantity.

In contrast to a vector, a scalar is a quantity with only a magnitude (and is one dimensional).

An example of a vector is velocity. An example of a scalar is speed.

Vectors in Kojo are two-dimensional (as they work with the 2-D canvas). Each vector has an `x` component, and a `y` component. These components give every vector a magnitude (`math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)`) and direction (`math.atan2(y/x)`). When you want to move a picture `pic` around on the screen, you can use `pic.translate(someVector)`. This will move `pic` by this given `x` and `y`. If the `pic.translate(someVector)` happens inside an animate loop, it will happen ~50 times per second.

Function description:

* `Vector2D(x, y)` - constructs a `Vector2D` value with the given `x` and `y`. Note that here Vector2D is both the name of the function and the type of the data value that is created/returned by the function.
* `pic.collidesWith(stageBorder)` - returns true if `pic` has collided with the stage border.
* `bouncePicOffStage(pic, vel)` - for a picture `pic` moving with velocity `vel` - this function returns the velocity after bouncing off the stage.

### Exercise

Write a program that does the following:
* Draws four rectangles at the center of the stage.
* Moves the rectangles towards the four corners of the stage.
* Keeps the rectangles within the stage borders as they move around.

Run your final program with both the Standard and the libGDX runtimes.
